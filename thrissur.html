This legendary school of art is located in Cheruthuruthy and was originally set up by the famous poet of Malayalam, Vallathol Narayana Menon. The story goes that he recognised a subtle decrease in the interest people had in Kathakali and other traditional art forms and thus started the venture. Today, the Kalamandalam is the foremost proponent of a variety of traditional performing art forms that include Mohiniyattam, Kutiyattam, Thullal and Nangiarkoothu. It is also an official deemed University for Art and Culture.</p>
